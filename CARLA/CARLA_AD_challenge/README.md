# CARLA_AD_challenge
A Repo for CARLA Autonomous Driving Challenge

# Instruction
CASIA DRL lab attend in CARLA AD challenge.

Based on 2019 CARLA AD Challenge.More detail on challenge can be found  
https://carlachallenge.org/

This repo consists major works on decision making and route planning for the scenario challenge.
Imitaiton Learning and RL algorithms are deploied to conquer the challenge.
